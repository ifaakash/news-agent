- **Integration with OpenFGA & OPA** – Compatible with popular authorization frameworks.  
- **Use Cases** – Securing APIs, multi-tenant SaaS apps, and IAM policies.  

**Why It Matters?**  
Cedar reduces boilerplate code for permission checks and is now available for self-hosting.  

**Open-Source Project to Try:**

### **3. Article: "AWS Launches EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint for Private Subnets"**  
**Source:** [AWS Compute Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/) (Published: 2025-08-12)  

#### **Summary:**  
AWS introduced **EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint (EICE)** for private subnets, eliminating the need for bastion hosts or public IPs. Features:  
- **Zero Trust Security** – Uses IAM for SSH/RDP access without exposing instances.  
- **Simplified Networking** – No need for NAT gateways or VPNs.  
- **Cost Savings** – Reduces reliance on third-party jump hosts.  

**How It Works:**  
Users run:  
```bash
aws ec2-instance-connect ssh --instance-id i-1234567890
```  

**Open-Source Project to Try:**  
- **[SSM-Access-Workshop](https://github.com/aws-samples/ssm-access-workshop)** – A lab for EC2 Instance Connect and AWS Systems Manager Session Manager.  

---

### **Final Thoughts**  
These updates highlight AWS’s focus on **AI security (Bedrock), open-source authorization (Cedar), and zero-trust compute (EICE)**. The open-source projects provide hands-on ways to experiment with these new features.

#### **Summary:**  
This article highlights **10 lesser-known Git tricks** to streamline workflow:  
1. **`git switch` & `git restore`** – Modern replacements for `git checkout` (introduced in Git 2.23) for safer branch switching and file restoration.  
2. **`git rebase --interactive --autosquash`** – Automatically reorders and squashes commits marked with `fixup!` or `squash!`.  
3. **`git worktree`** – Manage multiple branches in separate directories without stashing.  
4. **`git diff --color-words`** – Inline word-level diffs for better readability.  
5. **Custom Git Hooks** – Automate pre-commit checks (e.g., linting) via `.git/hooks`.  
6. **`git submodule update --remote`** – Sync submodules to their latest commits.  
7. **`git reflog`** – Recover lost commits or branches.  
8. **`git bisect`** – Binary search to find bug-introducing commits.  
9. **`git grep`** – Fast code search across history.  
10. **`git commit --fixup`** + `git rebase -i --autosquash` – Streamline fix commits.
